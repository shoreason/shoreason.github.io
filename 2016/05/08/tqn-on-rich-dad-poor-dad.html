<p>Secrets of Rich Dad</p>

<h2 id="secret-1-the-rich-dont-work-for-money-learn-how-to-let-money-work-for-you"><strong>Secret 1</strong> The rich don’t work for money (learn how to let money work for you)</h2>

<h2 id="secret-2-dont-let-emotions-fear-or-greed-drive-your-decisions"><strong>Secret 2</strong> Don’t let emotions (fear or greed) drive your decisions</h2>

<p><strong>Fear</strong> and <strong>Ignorance</strong> are the bigger causes of poverty
Ignorance about money drives greed and fear. Learn to use your emotions to think not think with your emotions.</p>

<p>You need financial literacy to be rich. Elements of financial literacy</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Accounting</em> (Ability to read and understand fiancial statements)</li>
  <li><em>Investment</em> (money making strategies)</li>
  <li>Understanding of <em>Markets</em> (Science of supply and demand. Does an investment makes sense based on the current market?)</li>
  <li><em>Law</em> (Understanding of tax advantages of a corporattion)</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to know the difference between an <em>asset</em> and a <em>liability</em>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rich acquire assets</li>
  <li>Poor only have expenses</li>
  <li>Middle Class acquire liabilities thinking they are assets</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Asset</strong> - Puts money in your pocket
<strong>Liability</strong> - Takes money out of your pocket</p>

<p>More money only accentuates the cash flow pattern running in my head.</p>

<p>What we really need a lsson on is not how to make money but rather how to spend it (financial aptitude)</p>

<p>Wealth = if I stopped working today, how many days will I survice (the measure of the cash flow from the asset column vs expenses). This is different from <strong>net worth</strong> = assets  - liabilties</p>

<p>Goal 1 - Get asset cash flow to match expense
Goal 2 - Get enough excess cash flow from asset to reinvest in assests</p>

<h2 id="secret-3-mind-your-own-business-build-and-keep-your-asset-column"><strong>Secret 3</strong> Mind your own Business (Build and keep your asset column)</h2>

<p>The rich focus on their balance statement, everyone else on their income statement</p>

<p>The business you are in is different from your profession</p>

<p>Real Assets
+ Businesses that don’t require my presence (I own them but they are run or managed by other people) - If I have to work there it;s not my business it’s my job
+ Stocks
+ Bonds
+ Mutual Funds
+ Income generating Real Estate
+ Royalties</p>

<p>Acquire assets you love</p>

<p>Rich buy luxury last, poor and middle class buy luxury first</p>

<h2 id="secret-4-own-a-corporation"><strong>Secret 4</strong> Own a Corporation</h2>

<h2 id="secret-5-the-rich-invent-money"><strong>Secret 5</strong> The Rich Invent Money</h2>

<p>Financial Literacy requires technical knowledge and courage. Smarts and guts</p>

<p>Learn to take risks</p>

<p>You need to understand what business you are invested in</p>

<h2 id="secret-6-work-to-learn-not-to-earn-not-for-money"><strong>Secret 6</strong> Work to Learn not to Earn (not for money)</h2>

<p>Things to learn: Accounting, Investing, Marketing, Sales, Negotiation and Law</p>

<p>You want to know a little about a lot</p>

<p>Seek work, position or role more for what you will learn than what you will earn</p>

<p>Education is more valuable than money</p>

<p>Management Skills for success
+ Management of cash flow
+ Management of systems (including self and time with family)
+ Management of people</p>

<p>Surround yourself with people smarter than you are</p>

<p>Use assets not credit to buy luxuries</p>

<p>Have Mentors or Icons you follow/imitate
George Soros
Peter Lynch (How does he invest?)
Carl Icahn
Steve Cohen
Jim Rogers
Warren Buffett (What does he invest in?)
Donald Trump (How does he negotiate?)</p>

<p>A stock investment strategy
Invest in stock at valued price
When it goes up take out original amount
Leave increase in the rest of investment</p>
