        <title>My 2016 Challenge : Kafka or MQTT for Messaging</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Messaging is a critical aspect to any distributed architecture. Even more vital in modern architecture is that you need a way to decouple actors or systems within your ecosystem. Pub/Sub is one model that allows you achieve this. In tthis model one component in your environment broadcasts/ publishes a message which can then be consumed/subscribed to by by 1 or more components or consumers. The compoment that acts as the middle man in this model is called a broker, which is what MQTT and Kafka do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MQTT&lt;/strong&gt; is a protocol made for light weight messages. It is great for situations where low bandwidth is a constraint and with about 2 bytes header size it is well suited for small devices like an Arduino and Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-characteristics-of-mqtt&quot;&gt;Key Characteristics of MQTT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lightweight (2byte overhead per message)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easy to parse for computers (length prefixed length)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Broker keeps track of client state&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Guarantees message delivery through retries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security (usr/pwd over TLS)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dynamic topics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Runs on TCP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kafka&lt;/strong&gt; is essentially a distributed commit log. Kafka’s claim to fame is its support for high throuhput and message durability even at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-characteristics-of-kafka&quot;&gt;Key Characteristics of Kafka&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distributed Log aggregator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Client keeps track of what messages it has processed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meant for server side environments (server to server)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Static topics (topic - static, key - dynamic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common features across both solutions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both brokers for pub/sub&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decouple consumers from producers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offer measure of reliability (QoS 1, 2 &amp;amp;3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both solutions address the key needs I have for messaging so which did I choose. Well I chose both. The essential thing about these two solutions is that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MQTT is suited for dumb clients&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kafka for smart clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my ecosystem the sensors at the edge capturing electricty usage, temperature and humidity readings etc  are simply observing an event and transmitting light weight data. In this case I use MQTT to pipe in their data. Kafka comes into the picture as the main broker through which all collected data are streamed over to the ELK Stack. I forsee Kafka playing a much bigger role when I pull in data at rest or batch data for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still working with these two to really grasp where they fit, but so far I feel comfortable about how they are used. I did come across some material on the web around problems with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoTclkxSago&quot;&gt;Scaling MQTT&lt;/a&gt;. Scale is not something I’m worried about around the edge, so MQTT does what I need. Kafka helps me manage the scale I have at the heart of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other choice I had to make recently was how to persist the data, which I’ll cover in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My 2016 Challenge : The Foundation (1 Min Read)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Technically I started work on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://shoreason.github.io/2016/03/31/my-2016-challenge-1-min-read.html&quot;&gt;2016 challenge&lt;/a&gt; late 2015. The goal remains to have something tangible done as the year progresses. This brings me to the foundation of all I intend to build: The Architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Software Engineer, I deal with Architecture decisions daily. Making best guesses on future design and ruminating on past bad decisions. In the Agile landscape I have come to terms with that fact that &lt;a href=&quot;https://shoreason.wordpress.com/2014/02/16/did-someone-lose-architectures-invite-to-the-agile-party/?frame-nonce=2e4aab6523&amp;amp;preview=true&amp;amp;iframe=true&quot;&gt;Architecture&lt;/a&gt; is really where you land and the initial key decisions are around mitigating risks. How much time one puts in upfront architecture decision depends on what you are building: A shed or a skyscraper. In my case I choose to land somewhere in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I typically advocate for a factor of 3 to account for the smallest unit of complexity. In this first round I was focused more on simplicity which meant a single node and single broker where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current tech-stack includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MQTT&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kafka&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ELK Stack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cassandra&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 Linux boxes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Programming language choice -  C, Python&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sensor Peripherals (Efergy Electricity Monitor and R820 Tuner)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/EfergyDataPipeline.png&quot; alt=&quot;Data Pipeline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my view from Kibana&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My 2016 Challenge (1 Min Read)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/vodafone_de/17768794394/in/photostream/&quot; title=&quot;Smart Home: Das digitale Wohnzimmer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/306/17768794394_d4dcb320cc_k.jpg&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1365&quot; alt=&quot;Smart Home: Das digitale Wohnzimmer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Mark Zuckerberg recently shared his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10102577175875681&quot;&gt;2016 challenge&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, he takes on something new every year and it got me inspired.  Making focus a priority is a goal of mine moving forward in life and it seems well fitting to articulate what had been brooding in my mind to take on in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My challenge in 2016 is to make my home sentient. I spend a lot of a quality time in my home and it only makes sense for me to enrich the experience. I’m not sure what this end point really looks like - Jarvis from Iron Man? Maybe not but, I know my interest is to start with capturing key information around my home like power usage and internet bandwidth usage to be more aware of what’s happening in the home. Measure such things as temperature, humidity and presence detection. This is also so my home can intelligently respond to my living experience. Essentially, me learn about my home and my home learn more about me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already started some work around power usage monitoring and will be sharing what I have learned as well as my journey to make a smart home. Yes, that’s the word. I expect this will have varying elements of IOT, Big Data, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. All areas I have been looking forward to take a deep dive into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I intend to write a monthly blog reflecting on my journey in between more technical blogs highlighting what I have actually done. You are welcome to tag along.&lt;/p&gt;
